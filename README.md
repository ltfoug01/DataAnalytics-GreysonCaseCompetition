# DataAnalytics-GreysonCaseCompetition
Work from my MSBA cohort for a Data Analytics Greyson Case Competition. 
Contains work in R and other relevant data files.

Overview:
Greyson Corporation is a media and marketing company involved in magazine and book publishing and in broadcasting. Greyson’s portfolio of home and family magazines has been a long-running strength, but they have expanded to become a provider of a spectrum of services ( market research, communications planning, web site advertising, etc.) that can enhance their client’s brands.

Greyson uses data to develop campaigns for new customer acquisition, customer reactivation, and the identification of cross-selling opportunities for products. 

For example, Greyson Corp. will generate separate versions of a monthly issue of a magazine that will differ only by the advertisements they contain. They will mail a subscribing customer the version with the print ads identified by their data as being of most interest to that customer.

One problem facing Greyson Corp. is how to boost the customer response rate to renewal offers that it mails to its magazine subscribers. 

The industry response rate is about 2%, but Greyson Corp. has historically performed better than that.

However, they must update their model to correspond to recent changes. The Director of marketing wants to make sure Greyson Corp. maintains it’s place as one of the top achievers in targeted marketing. 

A 2nd data set GreysonHoldout.csv is used in evaluation of model accuracy.
